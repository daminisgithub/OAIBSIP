First task = Iris flower Classification
Iris flower classification is a common machine learning task where the goal is to categorize Iris flowers into different species based on their characteristics. The dataset typically includes features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, along with corresponding labels for species (e.g., setosa, versicolor, virginica). 

Second task= Unemployment rate 
Machine learning can be applied to analyze and predict unemployment rates. By using historical economic data and relevant features .

Third task=Car price prediction is a machine learning task where algorithms are trained to estimate the selling price of a vehicle based on various factors. These factors typically include attributes like make, model, year, mileage, condition, and additional features.
